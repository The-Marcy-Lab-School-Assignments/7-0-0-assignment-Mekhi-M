# Question

What is the return value of the `useState` hook in React? Be specific â€” just telling us the type is not enough.

# Answer

`useState` returns a tuple. The values inside consist of the value passed into the function (`initialState`) and a setter function for changing the corresponding `currentState` value. The typical way to save the values within the tuple that is returned by `useState` is to use destructuring.

Example on how the returned tuple is destructured:

```jsx
// currentState (set to the number 28, in this case)
//      v
const [age, setAge] = useState(28);
//             ^
//        setter func
```
