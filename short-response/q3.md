# Question

What happens when the setter function returned by `useState` is invoked?

# Answer

The setter will update the corresponding `currentState` to the value that was passed in for the next render, then also trigger a re-render. If a callback function is passed into the setter function, it will instead be treated as an updater where it will take the value that the `currentState` already is and add onto it.
