# Question

In your own words, what is React and what are the benefits of using it?

# Answer

React is a library that makes use of components to make a user-interface scalable and easier to put together. As opposed to DOM manipulation, React takes much less code. Each component also refreshes on its own instead of the whole page refreshing.
